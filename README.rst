Import legacy data
==================

It is possible to import legacy data from `.xlsx`. Therefore the script
`import_legacy.py` was implemented. To run the script run::

    python manage.py runscript import_legacy

The script takes one workbook with multiple worksheets. The worksheets need to
be named `users`, `contributions`, `categories`, `repetitions` and `projects`.
The path of the imported date can be changed by editing `LEGACY_DATA` in the
settings.py. The default path is `../legacy_data/data.xlsx`.
